The goal is to run an experiment to see if there is evidence [softmax1](https://www.evanmiller.org/attention-is-off-by-one.html), also known as "Quiet Attention" can perform better than regular old transformers.

This is a humble experiment, on a fairly small model, so I am not expecting any big conclusions. It would be suprising if I found a solid result to be honest. However this experiemnt (and people's feedback) may convince me or someone else to run bigger experiments.

# The experiment

It is good to define what the experiment is before I do it and how I will evaluate the result. This will avoid temptations to change the experiment as I go to "fix" things.

## Model Choice

I will use a model that trains fairly quick and cheaply. This is the nanoGPT model. I will use this specific commit so you can reproduce this at home: [eba36e84649f3c6d840a93092cb779a260544d08](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/tree/eba36e84649f3c6d840a93092cb779a260544d08)

## Data Preparation

I will run the data preparation here: [prepare.py](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/eba36e84649f3c6d840a93092cb779a260544d08/data/shakespeare/prepare.py), but instead of Shakespeare I will use text from Reddit. The reason is I want to still have a look at what is produced and judge it by eye and that will be easier in modern everyday English.

This preparation script uses `tiktoken` encoding from OpenAI, with the `gpt2` setting.

The script to obtain the text and the text itself can be found in the [prepare](./prepare) folder of this repo.

## Model Parameters

I will use the [train_shakespeare_char.py](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/eba36e84649f3c6d840a93092cb779a260544d08/config/train_shakespeare_char.py) as the basis for the parameters, which defines a baby GPT model. I will double the size of the `n_embd` to 768 since we are now using bigger tokens and not just characters.

I will increase `max_iters` to 100000 to get more training done on both models. And increase `lr_decay_iters` to be consistent too.

## Code changes to implement softmax1

I have reviewed he following code, taken from https://github.com/softmax1/EsperBERTo/blob/7d2d5ed8695b95ade6bcbe21b7ce981b3c9394d7/src/functional.py#L7, and I will probably use this (subject to license being published).

```python
def softmax_n_shifted_zeros(input: Tensor, n: int) -> Tensor:
    """
    $\text(softmax)_n(x_i) = exp(x_i) / (n + \sum_j exp(x_j))$

    Note: softmax_n, with fixed input, is _not_ shift-symmetric when n != 0, and we must account for this.
    Normally when computing a softmax, the maxes are subtracted from the inputs for numeric stability.
    """
    # compute the maxes along the last dimension
    input_maxes = input.max(dim=-1, keepdim=True).values
    # shift the input to prevent overflow (and underflow in the denominator)
    shifted_inputs = subtract(input, input_maxes)
    # compute the numerator and softmax_0 denominator using the shifted input
    numerator = exp(shifted_inputs)
    original_denominator = numerator.sum(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    # we need to shift the zeros in the same way we shifted the inputs
    shifted_zeros = multiply(input_maxes, -1)
    # and then add this contribution to the denominator
    denominator = add(original_denominator, multiply(exp(shifted_zeros), n))
    return divide(numerator, denominator)
```

Todo: It might be worth figuring out the most efficient backprop for this? 

Todo: Describe the changes to the model.py

## Execution Environment

I will be using [modal.com](https://modal.com) to train and evaluate the model. 

The script [prep.sh](/src/prep.sh) will download the repo and replace any files that we needed to modify for this.
The script [lob.py](/src/lob.py) will do the job of running the code in modal.

## Evaluation

I won't use perplexity to compare the models as we don't expect it to change. However it will be recorded and might be interesting.

Instead we will use compressibility.

TODO: add more details. discussion is https://github.com/softmax1/nanoGPT_softmax1/issues/1
