The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is the Crystal Palace, down the road from the cinemas so you can walk in and sit in the courtesy seats. They're usually quiet and quiet and the drinks are pretty cheap.
Do you have a car? I assume you can visit the Wollstonecraft Community college?
I have a parking spot at work! Couldn't afford to park it. I'd rather pay the extra $40 for a permit. On the bright side, it's only $40!

I'm
---------------
The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is the one opposite central station.

The [Hungry Jacks](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/70/1703255/restaurant/CBD/Hungry Jacks-Hungry-Hills) is very good for all budgets.

There's also pizza at 4:00 in the city. The [Pizza Hut](http://www.pizza Hut.com.au/) is also pretty good, but go to the [
---------------
The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is La Mesa in Haymarket. I personally love the Haymarket one, but its overpriced and overpriced.

In the CBD, I just usually go to the Noodle House in Haymarket. My friend go there whenever she is here, and it's the best dumplings I've ever had.

Bondi is also nice, but it's not far from Maroubra.

I'd say Bondi is probably worth a visit. Only about a 10 or
---------------
The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is the Eastwood restaurant, however they're pricier than most places in the Eastwood/Strathfield area (the latter only has a few tables inside).

Good luck.

When you have the options, go to the fish markets with seafood in the city. You're better off going to Bondi for the best fish and chips in Sydney.

It's a bit far, but worth taking a look at:

The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is Pasteur in Eastwood. That place is a bit expensive for what it is but the place is good (well, I'm not sure how they are made in the US).
How about you go back to the gym?
Korean BBQ place on Pitt St. If that's where you're staying, I might have to go. Are you able to share accommodation for a week or something?
Wow, Iâ€™ve never seen any groups of people on this sub. 
---------------
The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is in the rocks; you can get a table from the bar, and can order a chips set and it's $5.50 and there's a nice view from the bar.

Edit: what's your topic?
Your local library, but that's what I'm after.
I haven't bought anything from them yet, but when I did a search, I found a bit of the first one that came up was an Opal top up. The second one was linked to a
---------------
The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is The Counter Burger. The atmosphere is generally pretty good and the food isn't too bad. And the food is great.

One of my friends did this last time and it was fantastic. 
I'm a bit late, but you could try joining us at the Sydney Cricket Ground or Sydney Olympic Park soccer. 

I have no idea how many people go but you could try the [Sydney Cricket Ground](http://www.sydneytheatre.com.
---------------
The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is the one at the top of the escalators next to Town Hall station - the main one with the stairs, and you can only get to the one with the stairs, because they're there for 5 min and you're only entering/exiting the escalators.

Not the best but they're certainly well cooked.

There has been a reason they've changed the name, but I've not been to a BBQ in a while.
I tried to call, but the driver had
---------------
The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is the 'Korean fried chicken' (they are one of the best in Sydney, but they have a huge selection on the menu). These are the only ones I've found (except the chicken and veggies ones which are way too salty). Best of luck!
This year is nothing compared to last year.  
Yeah, I've noticed a few but I'm not sure if it's the last year.

Most of the people I've seen that were made at UTS were
---------------
The best fried chicken restaurant I would recommend is the one on Darling Harbour, but it's closed early.

I've never had a bad experience there. The place serves great fried chicken and fish with the mushrooms/fish pickled radish. It's on the other side of the city, so that's not a bad thing.

For the same price and a delicious japanese patty, I'd go to [Agincourt Hotel](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Agin
